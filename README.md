# Text Correction App

This Streamlit application leverages a fine-tuned T5 model to correct grammatical errors in input text. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input text and receive corrected outputs.

## Features

- Text input area for users to enter sentences with grammatical errors.
- Real-time correction using a pre-trained T5 model.
- Displays corrected text immediately after clicking the "Get Correction" button.

## Requirements

This application requires the following Python packages:

- `streamlit`
- `transformers`
- `torch` (or `safetensors` if applicable)

You can find the exact versions in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

To set up the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my_streamlit_app
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure that the fine-tuned model files are placed in the `fine_tuned_model/` directory.

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run src/kk.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Input Text

Enter text with grammatical errors in the provided text area, then click the **Get Correction** button to see the corrected text.

## How It Works

The app uses the **T5 model** from the Hugging Face Transformers library, which has been fine-tuned for grammatical correction tasks. When a user inputs text, the app:

1. Prepares the input by adding a prefix (`"correct: "`) to signal the model to perform correction.
2. Generates a corrected output using the model.
3. Displays the corrected text to the user.

## Deployment

This application can be easily deployed to cloud platforms such as [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). 

### Deployment Steps for Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Sign in to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and connect your GitHub account.
3. Select the repository containing your app.
4. Streamlit Cloud will automatically install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` and deploy your app.
